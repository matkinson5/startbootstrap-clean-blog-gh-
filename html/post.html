                        <p>Blackbeard’s crew would have loved me, even though having a girl on board is basically a curse. Do I know anything about tying knots? No. Do I know the difference between port and starboard? Definitely not. Compasses confuse me and the mysteries of the night sky remain mysterious. I am not cutthroat, and looting is not my forte. Despite my obvious lack of pirating skills, when I was younger I had the “one thing” that labels a true pirate. Throughout first, second, third, and fourth grade, I wore an eyepatch. </p>
                        <p>I have amblyopia, which is a fancy word that means that one of my eyes is stronger than the other. The eye patch was used to cover my strong eye so my lazy eye would learn how to work. My introverted, hide-in-the-corner-forever, and “please-please-please-don’t-call on me” hated my eye patch with a passion. Mom’s attempts to doll up my eye patches with glitter and ladybugs and beautiful flowers (yes, those are all patches I wore) were in vain. I spent elementary school feeling like a pirate at grocery stores, parks, and worst of all, my school. I retreated further into my shell.</p>
                        <p>I need to point out that I did not retreat into my shell because of other people. I was not picked on because of my patch—any belittling came from my own head. Eventually, I didn’t need to wear my eye patch and what a blessed day that was! But I have not forgotten how alienated I felt when I wore that patch. Because of my patch I’m more compassionate. I notice, care about, and reach out to those on the outskirts who are self-inhibiting chameleons. They are more than welcome on ship “Brave Chameleon” with me.  </p>
                        <p>Today, when I see my old patches I still wrinkle my nose but I also experience feelings of nostalgia. Patch comes from the old French word pieche which means piece. I acknowledge that the piece of me that my patch helped build is a valuable one. There is no wrinkled old treasure map that leads to compassion, but if you are crazy enough join the crew and wear a patch.</p>
